# character.AI: A Case Study

### Origin
Character AI/[character.ai](https://character.ai) is a full stack AGI company that was created in September of 2022, however, it was first introduced on December 5th, 2022 on their personal [blog](https://blog.character.ai).
Founded by Noam Shazeer, who created Google's spell checker (Did you mean?), and Daniel de Freitas, who had led development of Meenna and LaMDA. Both Shazeer and Freitas were engineers at Google; they left, however, because Google was slow to release AI Chat Innovations. It was also said that they both wanted to see if LLMs could engage in open-ended conversations.

>"We started Character to lead the AI revolution and to bring joy and value to billions of people each step along the way."

Shazeer and Freitas weren't the only people creating the AI chatbot, in fact, they were joined by a founding team of AI leaders from **Google Brain** and **Meta AI**.
The platform of which was built for Character was built with the intent of evolving with the users

>"We own the engineering stack end-to-end, from data, modeling and training, to serving, user interface and experience."
>>With this, Shazeer and Freitas acn align their product and research roadmaps more effectively, optimize all elements in the stack, and engage their systems in strong flywheel with users.

### About
Character AI brings life to the Science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaboration with computers, building the next generation of dialog agents. In fact, it has a long-tail of applications:
- entertainment,
- education,
- general question-answering,
- and many other things.
In the words of the creators, Character.AI is considered (by their own terminology), a hallucinating supercomputer.

>"Needless to say, a hallucinating supercomputer is not a source of reliable information. Still, we hope that you find Character.AI a useful tool for immagination, brainstorming, language learning, and a host of other purposes we have ourselves not yet imagined."

Character AI is based on neural language models and allows the users to collaborate with the computer to write a dialog where the user types a message and the computer writes one in return; thus giving the illusion of having a conversation with a **fictional** or **historical** character, some characters aren't even character's, instead they act as **game masters** in a roleplaying game scenario.

>Some examples of available characters/AIs you can interact with on Character are listed as follows:
>- Albert Einstein (Historical)
>- Text Adventure Game (Game Master)
>- Super Mario 64 (Fictional)

What's amazing about Character is that users aren't just limited to interacting with pre-existing characters. In fact, the user base is encouraged to create and add their own characters to the constantly growing pool of AIs you can interact with.

### Competitor(s)

From the experience of utilizing AI chatbots, I have discovered a few competitors of Character.AI. One such rival is Janitor AI. Janitor AI physically looks different from Character AI in terms of searching for characters to interact with. However, Janitor AI is still in it's beta phase-- due to this, it lacks many abilities that Character AI has at its disposal.

Janitor AI does not have voices for characters or Group Chats. Nor does it have a mobile app for it to be used on the go, it only has a site that is accessible through browsers.
