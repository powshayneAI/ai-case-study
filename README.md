# character.AI: A Case Study

### Origin
Character AI/[character.ai](https://character.ai) is a full stack AGI company that was created in September of 2022, however, it was first introduced on December 5th, 2022 on their personal [blog](https://blog.character.ai).
Founded by Noam Shazeer, who created Google's spell checker (Did you mean?), and Daniel de Freitas, who had led development of Meenna and LaMDA. Both Shazeer and Freitas were engineers at Google; they left, however, because Google was slow to release AI Chat Innovations. It was also said that they both wanted to see if LLMs could engage in open-ended conversations.

>"We started Character to lead the AI revolution and to bring joy and value to billions of people each step along the way."

Shazeer and Freitas weren't the only people creating the AI chatbot, in fact, they were joined by a founding team of AI leaders from **Google Brain** and **Meta AI**.
The platform of which was built for Character was built with the intent of evolving with the users

>"We own the engineering stack end-to-end, from data, modeling and training, to serving, user interface and experience."
>>With this, Shazeer and Freitas can align their product and research roadmaps more effectively, optimize all elements in the stack, and engage their systems in strong flywheel with users.

### About
Character AI brings life to the Science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaboration with computers, building the next generation of dialog agents. In fact, it has a long-tail of applications:
- entertainment,
- education,
- general question-answering,
- and many other things.
In the words of the creators, Character.AI is considered (by their own terminology), a hallucinating supercomputer.

>"Needless to say, a hallucinating supercomputer is not a source of reliable information. Still, we hope that you find Character.AI a useful tool for immagination, brainstorming, language learning, and a host of other purposes we have ourselves not yet imagined."

Character AI is based on neural language models and allows the users to collaborate with the computer to write a dialog where the user types a message and the computer writes one in return; thus giving the illusion of having a conversation with a **fictional** or **historical** character, some characters aren't even character's, instead they act as **game masters** in a roleplaying game scenario.

([About Us](https://beta.character.ai/help))

>Some examples of available characters/AIs you can interact with on Character are listed as follows:
>- Albert Einstein (Historical)
>- Text Adventure Game (Game Master)
>- Super Mario 64 (Fictional)

What's amazing about Character is that users aren't just limited to interacting with pre-existing characters. In fact, the user base is encouraged to create and add their own characters to the constantly growing pool of AIs you can interact with.

### Competitor(s)

From the experience of utilizing AI chatbots, I have discovered a few competitors of Character.AI. One such rival is Janitor AI. Janitor AI physically looks different from Character AI in terms of searching for characters to interact with. However, Janitor AI is still in it's beta phase-- due to this, it lacks many abilities that Character AI has at its disposal.

Janitor AI does not have voices for characters or Group Chats. Nor does it have a mobile app for it to be used on the go, it only has a site that is accessible through browsers.

Another competitor of character.ai that the internet world believes is similar is ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is labeled as a chatbot, though through personal experience I can't determine why it could be a competitor with character. I've personally seen ChatGPT useed as a source of inspiration or assistance when it comes to getting writing prompts, or full essays written due to a user's laziness. From my occasional usage of ChatGPT, I've never had the experience of building a story with the AI like I have with character.AI.

Yes, you could ask chatGPT to compose a short story, but you don't really get to build up the story with the AI.

### Performance Reviews(?)
### Recommendations
From the research deducted, I have to admit that it is difficult for me to pinpoint any categories that character.AI is lacking.

Of course, if some of the updates that had come out in the past 2 years hadn't come out, I would have reccomended adding some of those functionalities in the future.

Instead, I have reccomendations for those different capabilities of character.AI.

##### Groupchat
The first reccomendation that I have for Character is to make it so you can utilize the group chat function on the web browser counterpart of Character. We already have the group chat mode on the app, so I don't know if it will be too difficult to do such a thing.

From first-hand experience, using the group chat on the app isn't too difficult, sure creating one is the tiniest bit complex as you invite other people to join it through a link/url instead of looking up accoounts that belong to other people.

The one problem that I see with the groupchats is how you have to hit a button with the character's icon to get them to interact/send a message instead of sending the message on their own volition. I feel like this 'issue' could be fixed in the source code of group chats by setting up *for loops* or *if statements* that check to see if a user has typed/sent a message before randomly choosing a character to respond.

##### Character Voices

With the inclusion of Character voices, Character.AI is one step closer to becoming a chatbot that enables vocal conversations between these generated character messages.

Character voices allow the user to give the characters they interact with voices/the abilities to physically talk to the user outside of a text format. However, as of now, we are not able to talk back to the bots without using the text functionality of the app. I feel this could be fixed if they allow a speech-to-text function to character.ai to make it seem more like you're actually speaking to the bot. (Some mobile devices may seem like this is already a function).

Perhaps character.ai can use a programming functionality to the likes of Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa so that the AI can understand what is being said to them-- and then piece together a proper response to what is being said. Like how you can ask Siri for the weather, and she will respond with a correct answer. 

([Is there an AI that you can actually talk to?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-AI-chatbots-that-I-can-have-a-verbal-conversation-with-So-I-can-have-a-conversation-without-having-to-touch-my-phone))

Through further research, and an update to a section of their blog including 'experimental phases', Character.ai is going to have a testing phase for 'Character Calling' which would allow users to have *seamless conversation* with characters of their choice.
