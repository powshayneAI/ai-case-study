- Character Voices in Group Chats
-- Voices in the chatbots were an amazing addition, and it would be cool to implement it into group chat scenarios instead of 1:1 interactions.
- Allow for users to interact with their own voices

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
- Utilization of the user's voice would likely have to implement verbal analyzing technologies for the AIs so they can understand what is being said. (This could be done via speech-to-text technologies)
